# Analyze LeetCode Solution Command

This command analyzes a LeetCode solution based on the problem identified from the filename.

## Usage
When a user provides a file or asks to analyze a solution, this command will:

1. **Identify the LeetCode problem** from the filename (e.g., `78.Subsets.py` â†’ LeetCode #78 "Subsets")
2. **Read and analyze the solution** code
3. **Provide comprehensive analysis** including:
   - Algorithm approach and explanation
   - Step-by-step code walkthrough
   - Time complexity analysis with detailed breakdown
   - Space complexity analysis with detailed breakdown
   - Key implementation details and optimizations
4. **Generate comprehensive test cases** (MANDATORY):
   - Basic example cases from LeetCode problem
   - Edge cases (empty inputs, single elements, constraints)
   - Corner cases specific to the algorithm
   - Expected outputs with explanations
   - Add test cases directly to the file if not present
5. **Provide execution instructions** for running tests
